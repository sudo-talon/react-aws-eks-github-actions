# Deploy React Applications on AWS EKS using GitHub Actions and Terraform.
We plan to utilize GitHub Actions and Terraform to deploy our React project on AWS EKS.

![readme (11)](https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/f4d89609-e506-4d10-b733-578202e27d6e)

## Overview:
We will deploy React Application on aws Elastic Kubernetes(EKS). We will use Github actions for the ci/cd pipeline. We will use EC2 as the self-hosted runner for our GitHub Actions. We will integrate Sonarcube for code analysis and Trivy Image scan to scan our docker images. Also, we will integrate slack to get Build/deployment notifications.

**Note** We will use/attach this AIM Role during AWS EC2 instance Creation.

#### Create AWS EC2 Instance
To launch an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04 via the AWS Management Console, start by signing in to your AWS account and accessing the EC2 dashboard. Click on "Launch Instances" and proceed through the steps. In "Step 1," select "Ubuntu 22.04" as the AMI, and in "Step 2," opt for "t2.medium" as the instance type. Configure instance details, storage, tags, and security group settings according to your requirements. Additionally, attach the previously created IAM role in the advanced details. Review the settings, create or select a key pair for secure access, and then launch the instance. Once launched, utilize the associated key pair to connect via SSH for access, ensuring the security of your connection. (Look at image Below)

  mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
  ```
<img width="765" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 6 02 16 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/ac459382-abc1-447b-a1aa-b54ac164db5e">


Command "mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner" serves to generate a fresh directory named "actions-runner" within the present working directory. Subsequently, it swiftly switches the current working directory to this newly created "actions-runner" directory. This approach streamlines file organization and facilitates executing successive actions within the newly formed directory without the need for separate navigation.

Download the latest runner package

```bash
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz

### Step 05: Installation of tools (Java JDK, Terraform, Trivy, Kubectl, Node.js, NPM, AWS CLI)

Use this script to automate the installation of these tools.

Create script on Your aws ec2.

```bash
vim  run.sh
```

Copy the Below given content

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo touch /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install temurin-17-jdk -y
/usr/bin/java --version

# Install Trivy
sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release -y
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg] https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy -y

# Install Terraform
sudo apt install wget -y
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

# Install AWS CLI 
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo apt-get install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Install kubectl
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl -y
curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
kubectl version --client


# Install Node.js 16 and npm
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nodesource-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_16.x focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs

```

Now Run this script:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh

./run.sh
```


Now Check if these tools are installed or not. By checking Their versions.

```bash
kubectl version
aws --version
java --version
trivy --version
terraform --version
node -v
```

### Part 06: Provision AWS EKS With Terraform

Note: Before starting this part 06, Make sure Terraform and AWS CLI are installed and an aws account is configured on your system. You can see my [article](https://medium.com/@codewithmuh/installing-and-configuring-terraform-and-aws-cli-preparing-your-environment-for-infrastructure-as-1be1d3d0e92) to get aws and terraform installation and configuration done.


Now let's clone repo:

```bash
https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions.git
cd react-aws-eks-github-actions
cd terraform-eks
```

This will change your directory to terraform-eks files.

Now Change your s3 bucket in the backend file. (You can create S3 Bucket on AWS S3)

Now initialize the terraform.

```bash
terraform init
```

<img width="1095" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 9 51 07 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/e008ec6a-504c-411d-8d54-5c65267363bd">



Now validate the configurations and syntax of all files.

```bash
terraform validate
```

<img width="605" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 9 54 29 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/718f9727-1c43-4792-a916-77a15fd3f120">


Now Plan and apply your infrastructure.

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

<img width="1204" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 9 57 37 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/852e41d3-7507-40d7-a51f-a8ed09b21a2b">


It can take up to 10 Minutes to create your AWS EKS cluster.

You can check by going to aws EKS service.

<img width="1213" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 10 14 31 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/0a391216-66c4-4a2b-81c6-af9ca89da27b">

Also, check your Node Grpup EC2 Instance, by going to EC2 Dashboard.

<img width="1256" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 10 15 25 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/bfc92120-34b8-441f-b9f6-4d59ead699d9">


### Part 07: Dockerhub and Trivy Image Scan Setup

Now you have to create a Personal Access token for your Dockerhub account.

Go to docker hub and click on your profile --> Account settings --> security --> New access token

<img width="1496" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 14 48 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/0eda48fe-8846-44e5-8d31-9484bc89801c">

<img width="1728" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 16 47 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/01387808-b200-4ba1-bba8-a5c2504d3a15">

Copy This Token.

<img width="1728" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 17 22 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/0d04f726-5db6-4926-af08-ccefc4e5ac8d">

Add this Token to your Github actions Secret.

<img width="1728" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 19 28 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/aa180559-88aa-4518-be58-88066b4e49b9">

Also, add another secret of your dockerhub username.

<img width="1724" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 20 09 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/0d0a87dd-e0e5-4174-809b-1b2b3d277f57">

Now create a new workflow with the name build.yaml . Make sure to replace the username and image name with yours.

```bash
name: Code Build Workflow

on:
    workflow_run:
      workflows: 
        - Sonar Code Review Workflow
      types:
        - completed
        
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Docker build and push
        run: |
          docker build -t react-aws-eks-github-actions .
          docker tag react-aws-eks-github-actions codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions:latest
          docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
          docker push codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions:latest
        env:
          DOCKER_CLI_ACI: 1
```

<img width="1728" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 34 04 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/49d0962d-001b-4d25-928a-6b9691ad5007">

Now you can check image is pushed to your Dockerhub Account.

<img width="1724" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 3 34 29 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/2ebb27ab-7d21-4fa5-8a08-8382ca83f132">


Now add another Workflow for the docker image scan, using the name 'trivy.yml'. Use the content below, but make sure to replace the image with your one.


```bash
name: Trivy Image Scan Workflow

on:
    workflow_run:
      workflows: 
        - Code Build Workflow
      types:
        - completed
  
jobs:
    build:
      name: Docker Image Scan
      runs-on: self-hosted
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Pull the Docker image
          run: docker pull codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions:latest

  
        - name: Trivy image scan
          run: trivy image codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions:latest

```

Here is the output of the build.

<img width="1496" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 4 51 28 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/5f5315e3-74d5-4490-9b7b-17c2b69fb32f">

```bash

Now add these lines into build.yml steps, so we can test image on our aws ec2 instance.

   - name: Pull the Docker image On AWS EC2 For Testing
        run: docker pull sevenajay/tic-tac-toe:latest
      

      - name: Stop and remove existing container
        run: |
            docker stop react-aws-eks-github-actions || true
            docker rm react-aws-eks-github-actions || true
  
      - name: Run the container on AWS EC2 for testing
        run: docker run -d --name react-aws-eks-github-actions -p 3000:3000 codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions:latest
  

```

When Build is completed , visit the websiet in your browser.

Note: Make sure port 3000 is added on your Ec2.


```bash
"Your_EC2_IP:3000"
```

<img width="1496" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 5 27 04 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/9e777278-d9c9-438a-9d41-086f558ac1f6">

If it's not working, Try to pull an image on your system and check for errors. Fix them then build the GitHub actions again.

### Part 08: Deploy Application(image) to AWS EKS

Now create our final deploy.yml file to deploy on aws eks.

And Paste this content there. (Do not commit yet, commit it after part  09)

**Note**. Make sure to repalce cluster name and region nname with your one.

```bash

name: Deploy To EKS

on:
    workflow_run:
      workflows: 
        - Code Build Workflow
      types:
        - completed
  
jobs:
    build:
      name: Docker Image Scan
      runs-on: self-hosted
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Pull the Docker image
          run: docker pull codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions:latest

  
        - name: Update kubeconfig
          run: aws eks --region us-west-1 update-kubeconfig --name EKS_cluster_codewithmuh
  
        - name: Deploy to EKS
          run: kubectl apply -f deployment-service.yml

```
This will updates the kubeconfig to configure kubectl to work with an Amazon EKS cluster in the region with the name of your cluster, Also deploys Kubernetes resources defined in the deployment-service.yml file to the Amazon EKS cluster using kubectl apply.


### Part 09: Integrate Slack Notifications

No Go to Your Slack and create a new channel for notifications.

Now Click on your slack account name --> settings & Administration --> Manage Apps

Click on Add New webhook to workspace

<img width="1496" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 5 51 38 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/563d3cc3-a81a-4e5e-9e68-27d23b5a2d5d">

Select Your channel that created for notifications and allow

<img width="1496" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 5 52 12 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/9a028aaa-55f5-4ce1-b16e-2d3c4bf2e0e4">

It will generate a webhook URL copy it

<img width="1496" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 5 53 14 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/f0b87569-cc5b-4207-8893-4a9f520a82df">


Now come back to GitHub and click on settings

Go to secrets --> actions --> new repository secret and add

<img width="1489" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 5 56 01 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/ea05fc0a-1cea-43ae-b349-ff08a75dff0a">


Add the below code to the deploy.yml workflow and commit and the workflow will start.

```bash

      - name: Send a Slack Notification
        if: always()
        uses: act10ns/slack@v1
        with:
          status: ${{ job.status }}
          steps: ${{ toJson(steps) }}
          channel: '#git'
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

```

This step sends a Slack notification. It uses the act10ns/slack action and is configured to run "always," which means it runs regardless of the job status. It sends the notification to the specified Slack channel using the webhook URL stored in secrets.


If you get this error, Try to configure aws cli on the ec2 instance to resolve this matter.

<img width="1355" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 8 57 56 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/9f83d0e3-81b8-49a0-82ec-8e3d54f63c6e">

Now our build is completed.

<img width="1341" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 9 17 57 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/69a5cdea-b740-4a2d-8d64-288f11688192">


And here is the Slack notification.

Let’s go to the Ec2 ssh connection

Rn this command.

```bash
kubectl get all
```

Open the port in the security group for the Node group instance.

After that copy the external IP and paste it into the browser
<img width="1419" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 9 23 10 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/9a6ac287-90de-451e-bc85-af71c35d5f51">

Here is the Output: The website is Live.

<img width="1377" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 9 23 35 PM" src="https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-eks-github-actions/assets/51082957/dec57ac6-922e-4803-b30c-224264129227">

### Part 10: Delete the infrastructure (To Avoid Extra Billing, if you are just using it for learning Purposes)

To destroy, Follow these Steps:

1. comment this line run: kubectl apply -f deployment-service.yml in deploy.yaml, adn add this line run: kubectl delete -f deployment-service.yml . You can say it replacement between lines. It will delete the container and delete the Kubernetes deployment.

2. Stop the self-hosted runner.

3. To delete the Eks cluster
   
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu
cd Project_root_folder
cd terraform-eks
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

Then Delete ths dockerhub token. Once cluster is destroyed, delete the ec2 instance and iam role.
